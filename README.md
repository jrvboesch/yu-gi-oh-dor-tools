Iâ€™ve always been a huge fan of Yu-Gi-Oh!, especially the game "Duel of Roses." However, one of the most frustrating aspects of playing was trying to figure out the fusions. Searching through wikis and forums was a nightmare, and it took far too long to find what I needed. This project is my way of solving that issue, creating a more accessible and user-friendly fusion guide for Duel of Roses.
